# gudetamaclock

A Gudetama-themed clock displayed on raspberry pi zero w with a inky phat display

Not only it has different Gudetamas for different time, it shows weather, temperature and moonphase (when the sky is clear during nights.)

To customize your location, change weather.py and moonphase.py with respect to your location

I recommend adjusting the "special days" in graphics.py as not everyone has the same birthday
